<h3> Inspiration </h3>
While brainstorming for this assignment, I came across (this)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZXOnR9qNDI&list=PLbLdd1fdNg5yp0x3_oRWeBur0FVX8PvFH&index=25] work of generative art and it immediately reminded me of ceramic tiles. I had already been thinking of using some grid layout for my assignment, and thought that making something using basic geometric shapes inspired by these tiles could be a good take at it!

<h3> Process </h3> 
I browsed through numerous pictures of tiles and created a bunch of sketches by hand to figure out what kind of shapes I would be using for the final creation. I didn't fully stick to the sketches, as I edited and thought of new ideas while coding.
