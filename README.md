<h3> Inspiration </h3>
While brainstorming for this assignment, I came across (this)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZXOnR9qNDI&list=PLbLdd1fdNg5yp0x3_oRWeBur0FVX8PvFH&index=25] work of generative art and it immediately reminded me of ceramic tiles. I had already been thinking of using some grid layout for my assignment, and thought that making something using basic geometric shapes inspired by these tiles could be a good take at it!

<h3> Process </h3> 
I browsed through numerous pictures of tiles and created a bunch of sketches by hand to figure out what kind of shapes I would be using for the final creation. I didn't fully stick to the sketches, as I edited and thought of new ideas while coding.

 I made use of the GUI addon to play around with positioning and rotation, and through using it I realized how functions like ofRotate() work, and where elements should be placed

 Then, I created the patterns in seperate functions and called the functions in the draw loop. Most variables were made with reference to fixed variables related to the center of the tile. I relied a lot on a grid to organize my tiles and their patterns. 
 
 For the color palette, I used a picture of a ceramic tile for the color palette.

 <h3> Reflection </h3>
 This was a really fun assignment to work on! I'm mostly satisfied with the visual output, but I would've liked my code to be a bit less hardcoded. Although I used reference variables, I think having separate classes for each element of the grid or global variables could've been more organized. 
 There are some elements in the code that I'm still a bit confused about. I managed to work around them, but I will be reviewing the code to gain more clairty on why certain elements behave they do when coded that way.
