  <h3> Idea </h3>
  When I think of stories, I immediately think of music. The music I listen to holds a lot of story that I'm constantly reminded of through the numerous playlists I make. This was the starting point for my assignment. How can I create an interactive piece that shows the role of music in helping us make memories and remember them? 
  </br>
  So, I decided to create a multi-part interactive piece, where a user can play around with sliders that don't control material values, rather immaterial feelings, such as "bitter" and "nostalgic". These sliders affect elements in the visuals or the song to achieve the effect determined in the slider title. 
  
  <h3> Elements <h3>
  <h5> Part 1: Introduction </h5>
  For the first part, I decided to start with a short text introduction to spark curiosity and provide some context for the work. At the end of this part, the user is prompted to click. Once they do, the piece proceeds to play the song and start the visual parts. 
  
  <h5>Part 2: Visuals & Sound </h5>
  For the visuals, I tried to brainstorm how certain visuals can communicate certain feelings. I reused some of the visuals I had for assignment two since I felt like they can capture a specific mood if altered in some way. The song could be made slower if the nostalgic slider was used, as slowed down songs tend to communicate a more nostalgic feel.
  <h6> Visuals A </h6>

  I reused the visuals from assignment 2 in this part, but I edited the element of color to communicate a "sweet" memory. The noise slider was linked to a "bitter"
  <h6>Visuals B</h6>
  <img src= bin/data/still3.jpg width = 30% height = 30%>
  For this part, I used a slider called "everything's blurry" to communicate the disorientation or desire to forget that one could feel when looking back. 
  <h6>Visuals C</h6>
   Here, I reverted back to a blank screen with some text to create some tension and match the buildup in the song. 
   
   <h6> Visuals D </h6>
   <img src = bin/data/still4.jpg width = 30% height 30%>
   Finally, I wanted to experiment with using random, different shapes, color overlays, and copies of an image to imitate a glitch.

   <h3> Some Design Choices </h3>
   <h5> Song </h5>
   Sweet Disposition by The Temper Trap is one of my all-time favorite songs, specifically because of the feeling of nostalgia that it creates, which no other song has ever achieved for me. It seemed very fitting to use it. 
   <h5>Images</h5>
   Similarly, I chose image from my own gallery - particularly ones that hold a lot of significance to them.
   
   <h5>Font + Color</h5>
   For the text I used Helvetica Medium Italic in this specific shade of color. This was purely inspired by a trend in indie filmmaking, where they accompany their film with such subtitles. This combination added to the overall nostalgic feel of the piece. 
   
   <h3> Final Reflection </h3>
   I absolutely loved working on this! Although it was a bit challenging at first to try to visualize how to use immaterial and emotional descriptors to control material variables, it felt very rewarding when I came up with ideas that worked. I listened to the song a lot, looked at the lyrics, and watched some music videos of songs that have a similar feel to what I'm trying to create. With this research and experimentation, it all came together. I hope the feelings I tried to communicate resonate with the viewers. Enjoy!
