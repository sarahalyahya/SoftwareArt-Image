<h1>Simple Cyclical Animation</h1>

When I read the word "Cyclical" in the sketch instructions, I immediately thought of a spinning globe and decided to base my sketch on that idea. My sketch is quite simple, it's a spinning sphere and flashing circles, in an attempt to resemble a globe and stars. 

</br>
The main animation approach I used was incrementing variables and setting rules to restart this incrementation. For example, with the alpha variable, my minimum value is 0, and maximum is 255. The program increments from 0 to 255 then the process is reversed and it decrements back to 0. I think this is quite a simple approach to animation and I hope to practice more complex ways to achieve more complex sketches, such as using time-dependent animation. This is something I will definitely be looking into for our Assignment 2.
